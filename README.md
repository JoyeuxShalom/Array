# Array
Let's say we have an array of first 45 numbers with one missing number. Need to find a missing integer from the list. 

To find the missing integer from an array of numbers, you can use the sum formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers. The formula is (n * (n + 1)) / 2, where n is the total count of numbers in the range, including the missing number.

The "findMissingNumber" function calculates the missing integer by finding the difference between the sum of the first n natural numbers and the sum of the numbers in the given array.
The missing integer will be the result of this difference.

Note that this method works when you have an array of consecutive integers with one missing number. If your array has more than one missing number or is not consecutive, you may need to use a different approach to find the missing integers.
